# 7-steps-of-machine-learning  INSIGHTS

   STEP : 1   DATA COLLECTION
                collecting the correct and accUrate data from right places USING SENSORS 
   
   STEP : 2   DATA PREPARTION  [cleaning, getting important insights, checking similarity with future data, splitting data]
                           (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual                                 methods. EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modelling or hypothesis testing task
   
   STEP : 3   CHOOSING MODEL  [acording to the type of problem and the type of prediction we want]
   STEP : 4   TRAINING THE MODEL [hyperparameters tuning]
   STEP : 5   TESTING / EVALUATION  [CHECKING THE MODDEL]
   STEO : 6   PARAMETER TUNING 
   STEP : 7   PREDICTION
